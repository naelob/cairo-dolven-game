Write a function called wizard which takes a matrix and returns 1 if the matrix is a wizard.
A matrix is a wizard if and only if the sum of each single of both its column and rows yields separately the same value.

Example : 

A = [
    2, 7, 6
    9, 5, 1
    4, 3, 8
]
A is a wizard matrix as :

    ROWS
    2 + 7 + 6 = 15
    9 + 5 + 1 = 15
    4 + 3 + 8 = 15

    COLUMNS
    2 + 9 + 4 = 15
    7 + 5 + 3 = 15 
    6 + 1 + 8 = 15
    
Everything yields the same value
